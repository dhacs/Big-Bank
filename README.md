# Big Bank Project

This project is an online ATM banking system that simulates popular banking functions such as login, deposit, withdrawal, and account transfers. It is designed to provide a user-friendly interface and utilizes various technologies to achieve its functionality.

The primary purpose of this project is to showcase the implementation of an online ATM banking system and provide a practical demonstration of software engineering principles. The project aims to simulate real-world banking operations.

Please note that this project should not be used for actual banking transactions or sensitive information handling.


## Technologies Used

The project incorporates the following technologies:

- React.js: The frontend of the application is developed using React, which allows users to interact with the system and perform banking operations efficiently.
- Python + Flask: The backend of the application is built using Python with the Flask framework. Flask is used to develop and connect the ATM classes that emulate banking functions such as deposit, withdrawal, and transfer.
- MySQL: The project employs a local MySQL server to host and manage all customer and account information securely. This ensures reliable data storage and retrieval for the application.

## Development Approach

The project was developed following proper software engineering principles, specifically utilizing the Spiral Development Methodology. This methodology emphasizes iterative development cycles, where each cycle includes planning, risk analysis, development, and testing. By employing this approach, the project was able to evolve and improve gradually, resulting in a robust and well-designed online banking system.


## Installation and Setup

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Node.js installed on your system.
3. Set up the MySQL server and configure the necessary database schema and credentials, found in the SQL Readme
4. Navigate to the project's root directory and install the required dependencies for both the frontend and backend components.
5. Start the backend server by running the appropriate commands.
6. Start the frontend development server by executing the corresponding command.
7. Access the application through your web browser at the provided address.

Please refer to the project documentation for detailed instructions on setting up and running the application.
